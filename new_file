I have created this new file in detached HEAD state and I will not be committing any changes to see whether these changes are arried forward when my HEAD is no more in detached state ...




I have to try something else also ... I have to commit the changes in detached HEAD state and see where do these changes reflect !!!  SO git clearly gave me warning that I am leaving this commit behind.
SO, I had to create a different branch to carry this commit forward... Note that all the later commits do not appear this new branch ....
